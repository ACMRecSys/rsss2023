The 2023 RecSys summer school will be held from Monday June 12th to Friday June 16th in Copenhagen, Denmark. Leaders in the field will give lectures on the practice, research, and state of the art in recommender systems. The lectures are covering a broad range of topics from an algorithmic as well as an methodological perspective and will also include hands-on sessions. 

The Summer School on Recommender Systems is supported by [ACM RecSys](http://recsys.acm.org), [ACM Europe Council](https://europe.acm.org/), [DDSA](https://ddsa.dk/), and [SIGCHI](https://sigchi.org/).
