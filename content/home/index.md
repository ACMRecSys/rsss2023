The RecSys summer school will be held as a pre-program to the ACM RecSys'19 conference from Monday September 9th to Friday September 13th in Gothenburg, Sweden. Leaders in the field will give lectures on the practice, research, and state of the art in recommender systems. The lectures are covering a broad range of topics from an algorithmic as well as an methodological perspective and will also include hands-on sessions. In addition upcoming and trending topics such as recommending to groups or affect and personality-based recommendation approaches will be addressed.

The ACM Summer School on Recommender Systems is co-funded by SIGCHI, the University of Gothenburg, and Eindhoven University of Technology.
The RecSys Summer School follows previous summer schools on the same topic, the frst having taken place in Bilbao in 2006, and the second in Bolzano in 2017. A Latin American School on Recommender Systems will take place in Fortaleza, Brazil in October 2019 as a pre-program to the 2020 ACM RecSys conference in Rio de Janeiro in September 2020.

Participation at the summer school requires registration via this website. Registration will remain open until the capacity limit is reached. Reserving an accomodation lies in the responsibility of participants. We provide pointers to recommended dormitories and hotels that offer reduced rates for the RecSys 2019 Summer School participants.
